## About Budget Buddy
Budget Buddy is a budgeting app for students to create a habit of balancing their funds and ensuring that they can make ends meet.


## Background
According to “4 Common Financial Issues for College Students” by Charter College, college students misuse student loan money, fail to stick to a realistic budget, and build up credit card debt. Since we are not taught how to manage our money, we come across significant issues that can potentially impact our academics and our ability to afford basic needs. The lack of financial education creates a problem that exists among college students. An efficient way to solve it is to create a mobile application that helps students manage their money.

## Proposed Solution
Budget Buddy will help students budget their finances to cover all of their expenses, better manage their income, and efficiently allocate their resources. It also includes a budget calculator that would consider the number of costs, financial aid, and revenue. This budget calculator will give the student a rough estimate of their disposable income after expenditures. The application suggests allocating those funds to cover all expenses and, if possible, also allow the student to end with a net positive. The application would also provide tips and resources to help them better budget themselves, save money towards a goal(car/apartment), and build credit. Thus, assisting students in developing better budgeting habits.through this web app.


## Running the Application

To run the application, clone the repo and open the whole folder using Android Studio. Note, API keys will not be accessible once the project is deployed.
