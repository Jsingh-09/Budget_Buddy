    "bank_Description":" - Only start out with one credit card. This allows you to keep your cards at a minimum. Applying for multiple credit cards will cause your credit score to drop. Multiple credit cards also is a higher risk for taking on credit card debt. \n - Only charge what you can afford to pay. This will help you adapt to building a better habit of managing your money efficiently. If you start spending more than what you can afford, that amount will eventually add up and it becomes the quickest way to build up a balance that you can’t repay. \n ",
    "best_For": " - Pay your balance in full every month. Although credit card companies allow users to pay a minimum amount of your bill, interest rates begin to add up each month for not paying in full when you got the bill initially. If you only pay the minimum amount, all of the extra fees can lead you to paying $100 for something that was only $20. This goes back to the “only charge what you can afford to pay” tip. \n - Stay under your credit limit. Each credit card has a certain credit limit (the maximum amount you can spend on that card each month), and this can depend on the credit card company as well as your credit score/income/etc. It is best to keep your charges within 10-30% of your credit card limit. \n",
